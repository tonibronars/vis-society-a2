			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning and Housing Supply</h2>
			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Which communities use single-family zoning most aggressively, and who lives there?
					<p><small>Reason: Based on "The Illegal City of Somerville", I am interested in investigating potential discrepancies between zoning laws and population distributions in the Boston suburbs. I am additionally interested in profiling the demographics of the people who live in these towns which are relying on aggressive single-family zoning (particularly when it does not align with where the population is actually distributed), and gaining an understanding of whether the population demographics differ in single family homes vs. other housing. If this were the case, it could point to who is most hurt by exclusionary zoning laws.
					</small></p>
				</li>
				<li>Is exclusionary zoning mostly about race, class, or both?
					<p><small>Reason: In "Exclusionary by Design: An Investigation of Zoning's Use as a Tool of Race, Class, and Family Exclusion in Boston's Suburbs, 1920 to Today", the authors assert that town planning documents from the 1960s and 1970s reveal that exclusionary zoning was undertaken for the explicit purpose of maintaining the socioeconomic and racial status quo in the Boston suburbs. I am curious whether we can use the census data to check if exclusionary zoning laws were "successful" in pushing out low-income and minority households. I am also curious whether household income or race, or both equally, in a town is most correllated with exclusionary zoning laws.

					</small></p>
				</li>
				<li>Is the MBTA Communities Act actually reaching the right places?
					<p><small>Reason: After reading up about the MBTA Communities Act, I am curious whether the MBTA designated communities are actually in compliance with the new law. Furthermore, I am curious as to whether there are towns that are "left out" by the MBTA Communities Act (towns that have similar need for transit access and high density housing, but that are not currently on MBTA routes). If so, we could propose targetting these towns for future MBTA expansion.</small></p>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			I started by reading the metadata, and discovered that each municipality should contain the following information: (1) the fraction of land area for single-family homes vs. other housing, (2) population (broken out by demographic), (3) number of households (broken out by size), and (4) number of households (broken out by income). Each of these are further broken out by whether the zoning is single-family vs. other housing. <br>
			To audit the dataset, I first checked whether the single-family vs. other household breakdowns were consistent by population and by land area (i.e. is (1) consistent with (2)). 
			I visualize the percent of single-family zoning by land area as a dark blue dot, and the percent by population as a light blue bar in Figure 1. Intuitively, the light blue bar should track the dark blue dot.
			While there were many towns for which the data was suspicious (for example, 0% land area / population for single-family housing), there were seven towns for which the data was demonstrably inconsistent (Figure 1).

			<figure>
				<img src="imgs/audit1.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Seven towns had inconsistent data when comparing land area vs. population in single-family zoning. Failure modes included no population data, land zoned for single-family housing and no population (Waltham), or population in single-family housing but no land area (Essex, Stow). All errors shown in red boxes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			I next checked whether the demographic breakdown of the population is consistent: i.e. is the sum of males and females equal to the total population, for each town? I repeated this check for all three of gender, age, and race. I found that in each case, the demographic breakdown of the population is consistent with the total population numbers. I show the representative result for the gender audit in Figure 2.

			<figure>
				<img src="imgs/gender-audit.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The population breakdown by gender is consistent with the total population recorded for each town. This is true for the age and race breakdowns (not shown).
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Finally, the metadata notes that two separate census years are used to report household data by size vs. by income.
			Therefore, I wanted to check how different the sample sizes (number of housesholds for which data is collected) are across years, to get a sense of whether it is reasonable to draw
			conclusions from the combination of household size and income data. If the datasets were both large, and similarly distributed across towns, I would conclude that the census data collection process
			was likely similar across years, and therefore that it is safer to combine data across years.
			However, I found that overall, the income dataset (dark blue bars, Figure 3) is much larger than the household size dataset (light blue bars, Figure 3), and that the data distribution across towns is inconsistent for the two census years.
			Furthermore, the same four towns are missing household size data, which makes it highly likely that the population data (Figure 1, 2) is coming from the same, smaller census dataset as the
			household income.

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			In conclusion, I found that while the census data for a given statistic is internally consistent (ex. the demographic breakdowns of the population indeed sum to the total population in a given census year), combining data collected across different census years (for example, analyzing the population and household size numbers 
			in conjunction withinthe income numbers) could yield misleading conclusions. I also found that different statistics, even within the same census year (land area vs. population), were less internally consistent. A small subset of towns had clearly inconsistent land area / population statistics, and a larger group had statistics that seemed
			unlikely to be accurate (ex. extreme disparities between the population and land area percentages for single-family zones).
			Going forward, I will filter out the data for the seven clearly inaccurate towns (red boxes in Figure 1). Beyond that, I will note where the reader should interpret my results with caution, given the outcome of my data audit.
			<br>
			To answer my first question "Which communities use single-family zoning most aggressively, and who lives there?". I started
			by building a definition of "aggressively". I visualized the fraction of land that is allocated for single-family housing, vs. the fraction of the
			population that lives in single family housing, for each municipality. I then split the towns into quadrants
			based on whether there was an above/below average amount of land/population in single-family housing. I then defined the quadrant with high land area and low population
			in single-family housing as the most "aggressive" zoning: these are the towns for which land is being misallocated to single-family zoning (Figure 4).
			Note that the size of the dots in the plot are calculated based on the log of the number of towns that share the same point. I chose log scale because the (0%, 0%) point is shared by 38 towns, and when I scaled the 
			size of the dots linearly with the number of towns, the point at the origin dwarfed the rest of the plot. I did not want to overly draw attention to the origin, because it is not relevant for the story that I am trying to tell with this visualization. 
			Also, I have a hunch that the origin points are a result of faulty census data (it is unlikely that 38 towns have no single family zoning, and no population living in single family homes). I left the data in because I cannot be sure that
			it is a result of an inaccuracy, but I also do not want to overly draw attention to something that could simply be an error in the dataset. I thought sizing the points based on the log of the number of towns sharing the same point
			was a good middle ground that negotiated this tradeoff for me.
			<figure>

				living there, are high-impact towns for zoning reform. They are colored and red and called out by name.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			I next dug into the demographic breakdown for single-family vs. other households in towns with aggressive zoning (high fraction of land, and low fraction of population living in single-family housing). I found that across both groups,
			the plurality of households earned 200k+ per year, but the fraction was smaller for other households compared with single-family households.
			Similarly, the majority of the population was female in both groups, but the fraction was higher in other households compared with single-family households. Finally, in both groups the plurality of households were white, but the fraction was smaller
			in other households compared with single-family households (Figure 5).

			<figure>
				<img src="imgs/result2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				In towns with aggressive single-family zoning, single-family households are higher income, more male, and more white compared with other households.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Moving on to my second question, I will interrogate whether exclusionary zoning is mostly about race, class, or both. A proxy for answering that question is whether race or income is more correlated with single-family zoning practices. To do so, I moved off of Tableau because I need to calculate average household income as a weighted average using the income bracket midpoints, which is very cumbersome in Tableau.
			Going forward, whenever I need to use average income in my visualizations, I will make them with matplotlib instead of Tableau.
			I created a scatter plot of average household income vs. fraction of white households for each municipality. The dots themselves are colored by the fraction of land area allocated for single family housing (Figure 6). On the axes of the plot, I also bucketed the average income / average fraction white variables, and plotted the average fraction
			of area allocated for single family housing in each bucket. The purpose of this element is to visually compare the strength of the gradient with increasing income / whiteness, with increasing amount of land allocated for single-family housing.
			By comparing the gradient strength visually, I found that household income is more clearly correlated with the amount of single-family zoning, since the redness and the height of the bars largely monotonically increase with increasing household income.
			On the other hand, the bars remain a similar height / color with increasing whiteness (Figure 6). This census data seems to indicate then that
			exclusionary zoning is more associated with class than race. One caveat to my results is that the income data and the demographic data / single family housing data were collected on different census years. Results should therefore be interpreted with caution.

Bars along the sides of the plot represent aggregated metrics, showing the trend of how the amount of single family zoning changes with increasing household income, and increasingly white populations.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			I also note that the trend is highly dependent on whether I include the 38 municipalities for which the dataset reports 0% single family zoning (Figure 7). As I mentioned in the discussion of Figure 4, I cannot be certain that the data is inaccurate, but it is highly suspect. Figure 7 shows the same visualization, now 
			with those 38 municipalities included. Their inclusion completely skews the result, destroying the trend we previously observed between household income and amount of single-family zoning.

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			To answer my final question, I first check whether the MBTA communities are actually zoning for other housholds, in addition to single family households. I find that 6 neighborhoods are completely non-compliant (Figure 8), and a majority of neighborhoods
			have less than half of their land area for non-single family housing. In this visualization, I again filtered the 38 neighborhoods with 0% single family housing, as well as the original 7 neighborhoods from the initial data audit. In summary, the MBTA Communities Act has not already
			compelled the neighborhoods already served by the MBTA to zone for higher density housing.

			<figure>
				<img src="imgs/mbta-compliance.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Finally, I wanted to check whether the MBTA Communities Act is actually reaching towns with the highest need for public transportation,
			which I define as towns with high populations and low income. My plan was to compare MBTA communities with non-MBTA communities against my metric, and propose high-impact regions for future MBTA expansion. However, there are only two communities 
			in my dataset which are non-MBTA communities (the few others in the original dataset were filtered for the aforementioned data quality issues). One of these towns, Bolton (blue circle in Figure 9), has above average income and below average population (when compared to the other towns in the dataset). The other, Milford, has below average income and above average population (blue star in Figure 9). Therefore, expanding the MBTA to Milton would be higher impact than to Bolton.
			It is also noteworthy that both non-MBTA communities currently have below average amounts of non-single family housing.
			<br>
			My analysis in Figure 8, however, pointed me toward a more pertinent question: for which MBTA communities is it most urgent to pressure compliance? In order to answer this question, I visualized all communities (except those which were filtered for data quality, see previous) on a scatterplot of average household income vs. population. I designated the quadrant with below average income and above average population as the "highest need" communities for transit access. I then starred the high-need communities with below-average amounts (by land area) of non-single family housing. These are the communities that the MBTA Communities Act is urgently targetting, but that are the least compliant with the mandate (Figure 9). These 9 communities are: Rockport, Swampscott, Foxborough, Randolph, Stoughton, Peabody, Framingham, Natick, and Milton.

The highest need communities (high population, low income) for which the MBTA Communities Act was designed (lower right quadrant) have nine communities (black stars) with below average amounts of non-single family housing. These are the communities for which it is most urgent to pressure compliance to the MBTA Communities Act. Of the two communities without existing MBTA access (blue), Milton (blue star) would be a higher impact choice for future MBTA expansion.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>In summary, we (1) defined a metric for "aggressive" single family zoning (large land area, but low population in single family housing), and identified a subset of towns meeting this definition as the ones that need zoning reform most urgently. We then profiled the demographics in those towns, broken out by single-family vs. non-single family households, and found that the non-single family households were lower income, more female, and less white than the single-family households. This helped us build a picture of who is being systematically locked out of housing by exclusionary single-family zoning laws (largely poor, female, and minority households). 
				We then (2) determined that exclusionary zoning laws are more correllated with income than whiteness in this census data. Finally, we (3) determined that many communities are out of compliance with the MBTA Communities Act, and most concerningly, that several high-transit-need communities for which the act was designed are out of compliance. These data can be used to pressure compliance for these communities in particular.
				<br>
				Conclusions aside, this assignment helped me appreciate the importance of carefully reading dataset metadata, verifying its assumptions, and sanity checking your data. All three steps were instrumental to me correctly interpreting these data. I also learned that
				sanity checking your data is a moving target. When thinking about the 38 towns with 0% single family housing zoning, I initially thought
				that including that data was a reasonable choice, even though it seemed implausible that the statistic was accurate. I did not choose to filter those towns in my data audit, and they appear in my results for Figure 4 and Figure 5.
				By my second analysis question, however, it became clear that I needed to re-evaluate whether to include those towns or not - their inclusion was completely changing the trend I was observing without them.
				It wasn't until I visualized a few different correlations in my data that I realized what an impact that potentially erroneous data was having on certain conclusions.
